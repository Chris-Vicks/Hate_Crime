# Hate_Crime

## Purpose
Hate crimes represent a concerning and complex challenge for communities and societies at large. These incidents can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the immediate victims but also the broader social fabric. As we delve into the intricate world of hate crime analysis, it becomes evident that comprehending the underlying factors and connections is of paramount importance. In this context, the focus of our investigation is on the intricate interplay between offender race and victim attributes â€“ two fundamental dimensions that shape the landscape of hate crimes.

## Exploring Hypotheses:
To better understand the mechanics of hate crimes, we pose two primary hypotheses:

### Null Hypothesis:  
The victim attribute does not matter to the race of the offender when  committing a crime

### Alternate:
The race of the offender race affects the victim's attribute when committing a crime
